Beautification on particular files using the built in Format Document (which includes formatting on save) can be skipped with the beautify.ignore option. Using the Beautify file and Beautify selection will still work. For files opened from within the workspace directory, the glob patterns will match from the workspace root.

Also runs html and css beautify from the same package, as determined by the file extension. The schema indicates which beautifier each of the settings pertains to.
